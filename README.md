Hi, I’m @devlock01

I live in Berlin and I'm new to GitHub. Intetionally I want to share some of my (python) code as open source and hey, why not
(virtually) meeting nice people around the world ?

Meanwhile is python (and pyqt) my passion. But there were also golden days with Perl, MySQL, PostgresSQL, jquery and the like before I 
met Django.

Well, I'm curious about the way awaiting me on GitHub. :-)
